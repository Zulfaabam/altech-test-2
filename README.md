# React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Vite

The tech stack that I use to build this website is React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Vite. This stack will give you a powerful and efficient development experience.

## TypeScript

I use TypeScript for better developer experience and adds the static typing to JavaScript. This allow me to reduce number of bugs and better code quality.

## TailwindCSS

It's just so simple when using TailwindCSS to style your website.

- Easy to use
- Easy to customize
- Faster styling

## Vite

I develop this React website using vite for fast setup & development server.
